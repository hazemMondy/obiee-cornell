all sorting operations are performed on the Criteria tab.

Helpful Hint: The “default” default sort order is ascending alphabetical order for text
fields, and chronologically from oldest to newest for date fields. However, that default
sort order for any column may be set differently in the repository, so that ascending
alphabetical is not the default. If that is the case, clicking the Sort icon for a given
column will sort in the order specified in the repository, and not alphabetically.

An example of what needs to be sorted in the underlying repository is Time, where you
do not want Months to sort alphabetically: April should not sort before February.

To sort such a column alphabetically → make it string → Time || ‘’

**Create a custom formula**

in Edit formula : “Table”.”income” - “Table”.”Expense”

> quotes are if there exist spaces in the name
> 

to make the data as percentages

if we changed a column formula after added a filter the **filter won’t update the changes**
